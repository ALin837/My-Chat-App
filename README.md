# My-Chat-App
A web-based chat application that allows users to register and talk to their friends privately within chat rooms
The application supports user authentication with access and refresh tokens. Additionally, the frontend is built 
using React while the backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io. Furthurmore, I used MongoDB as 
my database to store conversations and messages.

# How to Run the Application
Clone the repository and in a terminal run
```
> npm run dev
```
to start up your backend server 


In a separate terminal, change to the my-app directory and do 
```
> npm start
```
You should be able to go to localhost:3000 and interact with the application locally

# Lessons Learned
This is my first project that has both a frontend and backend. I learned about Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for 
backend websocket connections and I learned a lot about React on the frontend. Building this project made me realize 
that there are a lot of things to consider when building a large scale chat application like access and refresh tokens,
security, best practices when storing information in databases, and how to design an api.
