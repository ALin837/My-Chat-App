# My-Chat-App
A web-based chat application that allows users to talk to each other within chatrooms.
The frontend is built using HTML/CSS and Javascript while the backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io.

# Lessons Learned
This is my first project that has both a frontend and backend. I learned about Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for backend websocket connections and 
I learned a lot about JavaScript and adding messages on the frontend. Building this project also helped me get better at my styling with CSS as well
