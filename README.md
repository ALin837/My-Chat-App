# My-Chat-App
A web-based chat application that allows users to talk to each other within chatrooms.
The frontend is built using HTML/CSS and Javascript while the backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io.

Try it out on https://chat-app-heroku-alin.herokuapp.com/

I use VSCode but you should be able to do
```
> npm run dev
```
and go to localhost:3000 on your browser.

# Lessons Learned
This is my first project that has both a frontend and backend. I learned about Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for backend websocket connections and 
I learned a lot about JavaScript and adding messages on the frontend. Building this project also helped me get better at my styling with CSS as well.
